# Learn how to style a checkbox 

- We can use the :checked and :disabled pseudo-classes to change the appearance of our custom checkbox as its state changes
- :checked — the checkbox (or radio button) is in a checked state — the user has clicked/activated it.
- :disabled — the checkbox (or radio button) is in a disabled state — it cannot be interacted with.
